# 3. Univariate Analysis

1. Calculate and report absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables
2. Create appropriate visualizations to show the distribution of categorical variables
3. Create appropriate visualizations to show the distribution of numeric variables
4. Create visualizations to identify potential outliers in numeric variables
5. Calculate and report descriptive statistics for numeric variables:
   - Measures of central tendency
   - Measures of dispersion
   - Measures of symmetry (skewness) and kurtosis
6. Apply and document variable transformations (logarithmic, standardization, min-max scaling)
7. Convert continuous variables into categorical bins when appropriate
8. Encode nominal and ordinal categorical variables appropriately
9. Detect and document atypical observations in the data
10. Perform hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals where appropriate

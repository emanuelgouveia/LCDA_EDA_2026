# 1. Data Description

## Overview

This module focuses on understanding and describing datasets through initial exploration and statistical summaries.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and content of datasets
- Identify variable types (numeric, categorical, boolean, etc.)
- Calculate and interpret basic descriptive statistics
- Identify data quality issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- Create initial data profiles and summaries

## Tasks

1. **Dataset Loading and Inspection**
   - Load datasets using appropriate libraries (pandas, numpy)
   - Display basic information about the dataset (shape, columns, data types)
   - Preview the first and last rows of data

2. **Data Types and Structure**
   - Identify and categorize variable types
   - Check for mixed data types in columns
   - Document the dataset schema

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
   - Calculate measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)
   - Calculate percentiles and quartiles
   - Generate summary statistics for numeric and categorical variables

4. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Count missing values per column
   - Identify duplicate rows
   - Detect potential outliers using statistical methods
   - Document data quality issues

5. **Initial Observations**
   - Document interesting patterns or anomalies
   - Identify potential relationships between variables
   - Note any data limitations or concerns

## Notebooks

Place your Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder. Suggested notebook structure:

- `01_dataset_loading.ipynb` - Load and inspect datasets
- `02_descriptive_statistics.ipynb` - Calculate and visualize summary statistics
- `03_data_quality_check.ipynb` - Assess data quality issues

## Resources

- Pandas documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
- NumPy documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/
- Descriptive statistics guide: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics

## Tips

- Always start by understanding the context and domain of your data
- Document your findings clearly and systematically
- Pay attention to data types - they affect analysis methods
- Use visualization to complement numerical summaries
